Hi there,

Welcome to the Runescape Price Forecasting project!

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive project focused on forecasting prices in the popular MMORPG game called Runescape. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the future price trends of in-game items, enabling players and traders to make informed decisions.

The project involves developing a custom script that utilizes web crawling techniques to extract information from a specific website dedicated to tracking in-game items and their prices. The script is designed to crawl the website and gather relevant data about various items in Runescape. The collected data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

To ensure accurate predictions, the raw data is processed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant information, making it suitable for analysis. The data preparation stage is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the forecasting models.

Once the data is prepared, machine learning algorithms are employed to train models capable of forecasting future prices in the game. These algorithms leverage historical price data, item characteristics, and potentially other relevant features to generate predictions. Common machine learning techniques, such as regression or time series analysis, may be applied to develop accurate forecasting models.

## Project Benefits

- Gain valuable insights into the future price trends of in-game items.
- Make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in different items based on projected price fluctuations.
- Enhance your trading strategies and maximize your in-game profits.
- Stay ahead of the competition by leveraging data-driven forecasting techniques.
